# Analysis-of-Walmart-Sales
Walmart Inc is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas. My Goal is to understand how the sales are impacted by various features of Walmart. To understand the impact of various features on sales of Walmart I have used three techniques which will be useful to understand the other factors impact on Walmart sales and thereby used our techniques to boost the sales. I have used hypothesis testing, lasso regularization and clustering techniques using the R platform. I have used onehot, cluster, ggplot, glmnet and dataexplorer packages for analysis in R
